# Thrill Digger Solver (Skyward Sword)

A browser-only JavaScript solver for the **Thrill Digger** minigame in  
*The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword*.

This tool analyzes the visible rupee clues you reveal in-game and recommends the **best next move** using exact probability calculations, similar to a Minesweeper solver.

## ✨ Features

- **Exact probability solver**
  - Computes the chance each unrevealed square is a *bad spot* (Bomb **or** Rupoor)
  - Uses constraint satisfaction and weighted enumeration (not heuristics)

- **Best Move button**
  - Picks a **single recommended square**
  - Minimizes risk first
  - Breaks ties by maximizing *information gain*

- **Supports all difficulties**
  - Beginner (5×4, 4 bombs)
  - Intermediate (6×5, 4 bombs, 4 rupoors)
  - Expert (8×5, 8 bombs, 8 rupoors)

- **No dependencies**
  - Single HTML file
  - Runs entirely in your browser
  - No tracking, no storage, no network calls

## 🎮 How Thrill Digger Is Modeled

Thrill Digger behaves like Minesweeper with **range-based clues**:

| Rupee | Adjacent Bad Spots |
|------|-------------------|
| Green | 0 |
| Blue | 1–2 |
| Red | 3–4 |
| Silver | 5–6 |
| Gold | 7–8 |

> **Bad spot** = Bomb **or** Rupoor  
> Bombs end the game; rupoors subtract rupees, but both count as “bad” for clue purposes.

## 🧠 How the Solver Works

1. **Manual input**
   - You enter the results of each dig (rupee color, rupoor, or bomb)

2. **Constraint extraction**
   - Each revealed rupee generates a numeric range constraint on adjacent cells

3. **Exact enumeration**
   - Unknown cells touching clues (“frontier”) are exhaustively enumerated
   - Remaining unknown cells are handled combinatorially

4. **Probability calculation**
   - For each unknown cell:
     ```
     P(cell is bad)
     ```

5. **Best move selection**
   - Primary: minimize probability of a bad result
   - Tie-breaker: maximize expected information gain
     - More adjacent unknown cells
     - More adjacency to existing clues

This mirrors optimal Minesweeper-solving strategies.

## 🖱️ How to Use

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open `thrill-digger-solver.html` in any modern browser
3. Select the game difficulty
4. Click cells to enter what the game revealed:
? → G → B → R → S → ★ → Ø → 💣 → ?
5. Use the controls:
- **Solve / Update probabilities** — highlights safest and riskiest cells
- **Best move** — highlights the single recommended click

Hover over unknown cells to see their exact bad probability.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

- The solver **does not optimize rupee payout**
- Thrill Digger does not publish a rupee distribution
- The solver focuses on survival and information, not expected rupees

Assumes:
- Correct user input
- Standard Thrill Digger rules
- No hidden modifiers or scripted boards

- With no revealed clues, probabilities default to uniform.
